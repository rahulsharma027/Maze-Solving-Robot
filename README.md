This is a Non-Syllabus Project that I created in my 4th year as a CSE(AI) student for our Robot Programming Lab.
It's a team based project that I lead, majority of the work is done by me like coding, assembling and tuning the components.
I had a lot of fun creating this project, from the childhood I always wanted to create a super cool robot like this (except I want it to fly but that can be done along the way as I get the opportunity in this field).

Components used are: 
1. Arduino UNO
2. 1X Breadboard
3. Jumping Wires for Connection
4. 3X Ultra Sonic Sensors
5. L293D Motor Driver IC
6. 2X Motors
7. 1X Caster Wheel
8. 2X Wheels 
9. 1X HC-05 Bluetooth Module for Wireless Control 
10. 4X Double AA Batteries for powering the motor IC and motors.
11. 1X 9V Battery for powering Arduino UNO.
12. Robot chasis is made up of Bakelite Sheet (it's cheaper than regular chais so I choose this it highly insulating properties).
13. 4-6X Large Bolts and 20X Screws for creating support.

Technology used: C++ and Arduino IDE


Here is the Final Robot:

There are various algorithms that can be used to solve a maze with Arduino UNO like:
1. Flood Fill
2. A* Algorithm
3. Left-Hand Algorithm
4. Right-Hand Algoritm

I applied Left-Hand Algorithm in this project as the clock speed of base Arduino UNO is slower than its varients like Arduino Nano and Arduino Giga R1 so it's suitable for smooth lower grade algorithm.


Now that I've built this project I can surely build more advanced version of this same project with powerful components that can solve a maze super fast.
